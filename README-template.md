### What I learned

I took this challenge so that i can improve my CSS skill, it's fun to design your website using pure CSS, sure it can be hard sometimes, but it's fun when you got used to it.

### Continued development

I haven't learned some CSS properties, so i will definitely focus on that

### Useful resources
